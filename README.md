# Memory Game 🧠

Welcome to the Memory Game! This classic game tests your memory and cognitive skills by challenging you to match pairs of cards. The goal is to find all the matching pairs by flipping cards two at a time.

## Features ✅

- Simple and intuitive gameplay.
- A grid of face-down cards.
- The objective is to match pairs of identical cards.
- A timer to track your progress.
- A move counter to keep you on your toes.
- A win screen to celebrate your victories.

## How to Play 🪜
1. To start the game, simply open the HTML file in your web browser.
2. You'll be presented with a grid of face-down cards.
3. Click on a card to reveal its image.
4. Click on another card to reveal its image.
5. If the two cards match, they will remain face up.
6. If they do not match, they will flip back face down.
7. Continue selecting pairs of cards until you've matched all of them.
8. Try to complete the game with the fewest moves and in the fastest time.









## Scoring 🔢

Your performance in the game is measured by the following metrics:

- **Moves :** Each time you flip two cards, it counts as one move.
- **Time :** The timer keeps track of how long it takes you to complete the game.

## Reflection ✍️

### Introduction
Making a memory game was a fun and difficult experience that gave us the chance to experiment with different aspects of game development and design. This reflection sheds light on the steps we took, the difficulties we encountered, the successes and failures we had, and the lessons we discovered while creating our memory game.

### The Concept
The idea behind our journey started with creating a traditional memory game that would appeal to players of all ages. The idea of the game was straightforward: players would have to test their memory and focus while matching pairs of cards with identical images. Our project was built around this straightforward but classic concept.

### Challenges Faced

### 1. Game Logic and Interactivity

Creating the interactivity and game logic was one of the early difficulties. We had to make sure that the codebase remained manageable and organized while still allowing the game to react fluidly to user input. The design of the game's fundamental features, such as matching, card flipping, and game progression, took some time.

### 2. User Experience
Creating an enjoyable and intuitive user experience was a priority. We faced challenges in optimizing the game's performance, especially when dealing with transition of cards. Balancing the aesthetic appeal of the game with smooth gameplay was a continuous challenge.

### What Worked Well

### 1. Collaboration

This project's collaborative element was a huge success. We could work more productively if we distributed the work among the team members. The development process went more smoothly because of the constant communication and updates that made sure everyone was on the same page.

### 2. User Feedback

We identified and fixed usability issues with the help of early testers' user feedback. The user experience was considerably improved by making iterative changes in response to this input.

### What Didn't Work

### 1. Initial Time Estimations
We had overestimated the project's completion time at first. The project timeline was overrun because we misjudged how complicated some features would be. This taught us the value of having more reasonable expectations and scheduling time for unforeseen difficulties.

### Lessons Learned

### 1. Planning is Key
Before beginning any development, careful planning and design are necessary. It would have been easier to implement if we had taken more time to define the game's architecture and mechanics.

### 2. User-Centered Design
It is crucial to take the user's experience into account. Prioritizing usability and getting user input early in the development process helped us make the required advancements.

### 3. Realistic Time Management
It's critical to establish reasonable deadlines and allow for unforeseen difficulties. More time should be set aside for emergencies rather than rushing development and sacrificing quality.

### Conclusion

It was a satisfying learning experience to create a memory game, and it taught us the value of simplicity in game design, frequent testing, and user experience. Along the journey, we encountered many obstacles, but we also achieved great success in terms of the user interface, increasing difficulty. We really hope that players will find our game to be entertaining, demanding, and an excellent means of honing their memory and focus. Our goal is to further investigate game development, emphasizing user-centered design and straightforward, entertaining gameplay, as this project has inspired us to do.
